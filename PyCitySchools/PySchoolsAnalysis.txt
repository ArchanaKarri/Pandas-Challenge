Analysis: PySchools Data Analysis

Based on the given data, I have noticed these 2 trends.

1. When the data is sorted based on the size of the schools, 
   I observed that Schools with less students perform better in all areas when compared to medium and large schools
2. When the data is calculated based on the type of the schools,
   I observed that Independent schools perform better than the Government schools.
