# Pandas-Challenge
Pandas assignment
This program create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyse school and standardised test data.

Background
As a  new Chief Data Scientist for my local government area. In this capacity, I'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I've been asked to analyse the area-wide standardised test results. I was given access to every student's maths and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Local Government Area (LGA) Summary
Creating a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame, including the following:

Total schools

Total students

Total budget

Average maths score

Average reading score

% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

School Summary
Creating a DataFrame that summarises key metrics about each school, including the following:

School name

School type

Total students

Total school budget

Per student budget

Average maths score

Average reading score

% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Creating a DataFrame that highlights the top-5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

School name

School type

Total students

Total school budget

Per student budget

Average maths score

Average reading score

% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Creating a DataFrame that highlights the bottom-5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

School name

School type

Total students

Total school budget

Per student budget

Average maths score

Average reading score

% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

Maths Scores by Year
Creating a DataFrame that lists the average maths score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.

Reading Scores by Year
Creating a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.

Scores by School Spending
Creating a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student). Use your judgment to created four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending. Include the following metrics in the table:

Average maths score

Average reading score

% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

Scores by School Size
Creating a table that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

Scores by School Type
Creating a table that breaks down school performance based on school type (government or independent).

After all the steps, my data is analysed and an Analysis report is saved in Analysis.Txt in the same folder where my program is stored
